# VisionMeet

VisionMeet is a video calling web application built using modern web technologies such as React.js with Vite, Node.js, and the WebRTC library. This project allows server connections to facilitate real-time communication between users in a shared lobby.

## Features

- **Real-time video and audio sharing:** Users can connect with each other using their video stream and microphone.
- **Multi-user lobby support:** The server allows two different email IDs to connect to the same lobby.
- **Lobby management:** Provides a shared lobby for communication, with video and audio streaming between users.
- **Peer-to-peer connection:** Utilizes WebRTC for direct media sharing between users.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js (with Vite):** For building the frontend of the application with fast development and optimized performance.
- **Node.js:** Server-side environment to handle user connections and lobby management.
- **WebRTC:** Enables real-time video and audio communication directly between browsers.
